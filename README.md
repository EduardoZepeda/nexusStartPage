# NexusStartPage
A simple startpage with CRUD capabilities based on localStorage. It uses Backbone, Jquery and Bootstrap

### Activate localStorage
This site relies on localStorage to store data. Please refer to your browser settings to activate it. 

For Google Chrome enter [here](https://techglimpse.com/enable-localstorage-support-google-chrome-browser/)

### How to Add or modify sections
To add or modify sections open the js/sections.js file and modify the following line of code:

```
sections = ['Social', 'Mail', 'Media', 'Shops', 'Programming', 'Blogs', 'Others', 'News', '4chan'];
```

### Todo
There are a lot of things I would love to improve. Any contribution will be appreciated.

- [ ] Create a better design
- [ ] Add or remove sections directly on the website
